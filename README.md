This repo  contains  my solutions to the freeCodeCamp academy backend and API course. 

# Instructions for running the project and passing the test cases on freecodecamp
1. install node on PC - instructions available on the internet
2. clone the boilerplate repositories(repo) from freecodecamp  , for example: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm/ , to clone npm repo and : https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-express/ , to clone the express repo, etc...
3. cd into the boilerplate repo and run the command: npm install - to install the dependecies found inside package.json (one of them is 'express.js')
4. follow instructions on freecodecamp to complete task - for instance the 1st task requires the addition of the 'author' field
